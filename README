NXCCS Thumbnailer
=================

The Thumbnailer uses oEmbed and various website screenshot services to create
a thumbnail out of anything you throw at it. Depending on the user-defined
maximum sizes, it may resize the image and upload it to Amazon S3.

DEPENDENCIES
============

Currently the Thumbnailer relies on Google App Engine's webapp framework. If you
want to run it on your own machine, you can either download the App Engine SDK
at http://code.google.com/appengine/ or substitute webapp for web.py.

The Thumbnailer also uses the boto library's S3 functions to cache thumbnails.
boto 1.9b is included with the distribution as boto.zip.

For oEmbed functionality, the Thumbnailer uses Embed.ly's service, although this
can be replaced with any other oEmbed provider if you wish.

CONFIGURING
===========

You can configure your instance of the Thumbnailer using the config.yaml file.
It is in YAML format, just like app.yaml. 

URLs for screenshot services (under "screenshotters") use regular expressions.
For example:

 - service: example
   url: http://www.example.com/api?url=(?P<url>[.*]+)&width=(?P<maxwidth>[0-9]+)&height=(?P<maxheight>[0-9]+)
